Build deployment: https://hh.tsaari42.net

## Character Creation (..yes, the hardest part of any game)

### Name your character..
- Text input box ->
- Random name button ->
- Aaaargh, give me a random character! _Now_! ->>>>> <u>Starts the game instantly and abrubtly</u>

### Sex
- "Male", "Female", "Other" ->

### Class
- "Barbarian", "Magus", "Ranger" ->
- More later.

### Attribute Points
- Strength (STR)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Body (BDY)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Magic "..mfs" (MAG)
- Charisma (CHA)

Traditional point-buy, where an attribute gets more expensive more you put into it. Choices.

For you, every attribute starts at 1. Average human has zero.

### Traits (and flaws)
- Max 2 points. For now, at least.
- Can also make a character with less than the maximum points ...might even make that a trait, "Not Living Up To Your Full Potential"? Nah, too long.
- Some traits can be toggled on/off later, "Toggleable".

| Trait         | Points  | Description | Toggleable |
| ---           | ---     | ----------- | --- |
| Alert As..    | +2      | +10 INI. Nobody surprises you! Maybe. | |
| Bloody As..   | 0       | Heads will roll. And explode. Basically.. blood. Everywhere. And body parts. You have been warned. <br><br>Weird, this trait doesn't cost anything. | Yes |
| Beat It       | 1       | +2 STR, +20% melee damage, -4 INT. After a crit, you roll twice to hit. You also sometimes throw one-liners around. Like "Puny god" or something along those lines. | |
| Cow..Person?  | +1      | All ranged attacks cost 1AP less, but more importantly you sling your weapon back to holster like a pro. | |
| Moar Crits!   | +1      | +10% crit chance, -30% damage. | |
| It Happens..  | 0       | +20% critical failure chance to you.. and everyone else! | |
| Wow So Flow!  | 0       | +20% critical success chance to you.. and everyone else! | |
| Sex Bomb      | 1       | Opposite sex reacts more favorably, but more conflicts with same sex. But only verbal. Maybe. | |
| Curious..     | 1       | You learn skills at double rate. +1 INT. | |
| Not The Dog.. | 1       | +10% crit chance, -20% damage to you, +2% health regen. You don't have your Dog companion. And you are unable to smile anymore. | |
| Unlucky       | -2      | +30% critical failure chance. Everything goes sideways. But you are used to it. | |
| Don't Kill Me | -1      | You randomly run away in panic when your health drops below 50%. Screaming. Lasts for three turns. Can trigger only once in a combat. | |
| Brainiac      | +2      | +2 INT, but you cannot attack in melee even if your life depends on it. Also you think that logical intelligence makes you a better person. You are a member of a shady elitist cult. | |
| Timelord      | +3      | If you fail an attack/check, you roll again. If you die, you will be instantly reincarnated, but looking different. And maybe not same sex. Can trigger only once in combat. | |
| Starlord      | +2      | You have the best music. And style. Also, you Dog companion can speak. |
| Economist     | +1      | You buy everything 33% cheaper and sell everything with +33% price. Business is where you find it. | |
| MFSnakesAgain!| +1      | +2 CHA, but snakes randomly appear and attack you. Also, you have -10 INI against Sharks. | |
| I Love Loot!  | +2      | Double the rate of loot. You love it. |
| So Magical    | +2      | You are a magical person. Everyone sees it. +2 MAG. |
| Powaaah!      | +1      | +9 MAG, -5 STR, -5 DEX, -5 BDY, -5 INT, -5 CHA. You were in a weird space-time accident. |
